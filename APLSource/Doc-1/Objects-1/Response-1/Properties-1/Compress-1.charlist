# Compress

Applies to:{.prefix}

Response{.info}

The Compress property specifies wether or not Rumba should attempt to apply content encoding. Its
default value is 1. It should be set to 0 for content that is natively compressed. In addition,
small responses may not benefit from compression. Compression will only occur if Compress is set
to 1, AND Rumba and the client can agree on a compression type. Rumba only supports gzip at this time.

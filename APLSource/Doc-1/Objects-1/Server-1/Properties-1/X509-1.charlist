# X509

When →[Secure] is 1 then this must hold an instance of the X509Cert class (which is part of Conga) created from
a certificate file.

Notes:

* The property "KeyOrigin" must be set to the associated certificate key file.

* Before the function X509Cert.ReadCertFromFile can be called Conga must have been initialized.

For an example see #.CarlisleGroup.Rumba.TestServer.Start
